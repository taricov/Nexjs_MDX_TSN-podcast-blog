hmmm.. I'm a software engineer, coming from a business background. I have experience with TypeScript, Next.js, and Python and I'm dedicated to staying on top of the latest trends and technologies in the field, with a particular passion for AI/Data-driven software/tools. 

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and adventures where I can explore new possibilities and beyond.

*btw, my inbox is open, you are always welcome 😊

► TL;DR

⚙️ My tech stack: 
---- Fullstack: NextJs, NuxtJs, Sveltkit, MySQL, Py.
---- AI/ML: Python, R, Julia, Scala (...learning)
---- API/others:  NodeJs, Golang, C++

🔑 My keywords: rockN'roll, coffee, travel, startup, ai

Before graduation, I freelanced some graphic gigs and UI projects for two years. These skills are still useful today as carry-on knowledge in my field of work.

I am originally a Finance grad who worked in business development and sales before I switch gears and go north following my star, and delve into tech. (I would like actually to mention here these Sales days and how I really enjoyed working at the front lines)

Data was my first entry point to coding and still my dearest gig where I was introduced at first to Python, and this a bit of R to solve problems and automate daily tasks. Actually, that last one took me far forward in time and hit a hot spot in my mind so I used to make custom tools for my non-programer fellas to ease their lives a bit. I did almost 15 tools/commands ✨

Working in Software was the cherry on top of my cake 🥮 where I got myself exposed to the interesting world of solving many people's problems in one shot, I kinda feel like it extends my desire and effort in making these little tiny custom toolings for colleagues, so now it's the same thing, however, on-scale and for common business problems .. so welcome to the jungle 

⚡️ Last Year  ⚡️ Here are some facts:

⭐️ 195% Revenue increase from Q to Q (Q4 2021 - Q1 2022)
⭐️ I achieved alone 41% of all revenue in my team (Q1 2022)

 I'm grateful for all my experiences so far, which have given me a whole new perspective on the future.

**Tools/Langs I use/used to use:  
- Design: Krita, Adobe Stack (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign), Figma.
- Data: Microsoft Suite (Advanced Excel), PowerBI, Tableau, Python, R.
- Tech::earlier:: Javascript, jQuery, Sass, CSS, HTML, PHP[Laravel] (little exposure), Ruby[Rails] (little exposure)
- Tech.current=> Typescript, NextJs (framework on top of ReactJs), NuxtJs (framework on top of VueJs), Sveltekit, Tailwind, Golang, C++, (...learning Scala)
