# The Future of Resumes: Coding Skills Required for All

The year is 2033. The world has changed a lot in the past 10 years. Technology has advanced at an unprecedented rate, and automation has taken over many jobs that were once done by humans. In this new world, the ability to code is essential for success in any field.

Even for jobs that don't traditionally require coding, such as teaching or medicine, candidates will need to be able to code in order to train and work with the machines that will be doing most of the work.

For example, a teacher in the future might need to be able to code in order to create interactive learning materials that are tailored to each student's individual needs. A doctor might need to be able to code in order to program a surgical robot. And a fitness trainer might need to be able to code in order to create custom workout programs for each client.

Of course, not everyone will need to be a master coder. But even basic coding skills will be essential for getting a job in the future. So if you're not already coding, now is the time to start learning.

Here are some tips for getting started with coding:

* There are many free online resources that can teach you the basics of coding.
* There are also many coding bootcamps that can teach you the skills you need in a more structured environment.
* Once you have some basic coding skills, start applying them to your own projects. This will help you learn more and build your portfolio.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online communities and forums where you can get help from other coders.

Coding is a skill that will only become more important in the future. So if you want to stay ahead of the curve, start learning to code today.
